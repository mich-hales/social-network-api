# The Spectacular Social Network API

## Description

This web application is an API built for a social networking where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. The application uses Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the [Express.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) packages, the native JavaScript `Date` object is used to format timestamps.

## Usage

The application requires Node.js. To install run `npm install` on the command line from the cloned repository. 

After Node.js is installed, the server can be started by running `node index.js` from the command line. 

When the user opens API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts, the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON.

When API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes are tested in Insomnia, the user is able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in the database.

When API POST and DELETE routes are tested in Insomnia, the user is able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list.
